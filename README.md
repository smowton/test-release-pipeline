# test-release-pipeline

This is a test project to test `Github Actions` in order to release artifacts 
to `Maven Central` upon manual tagging of a commit.

The `Github Actions` should furthermore activate on each pull-request. The 
main branch therefore will be protected later on to force stuff through an 
automatic CI pipeline.
